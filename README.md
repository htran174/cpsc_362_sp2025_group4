Proccess Model: Evolutionary

Project Overview: Amazon-Inspired E-Commerce Webstore

Our goal is to develop a simplified e-commerce webstore inspired by Amazon's design and functionality. Following the Evolutionary Model, we aim to plan and create a functional prototype as our starting point. Once established, we will iteratively improve and innovate upon the initial version, ensuring continuous refinement and growth over time.
